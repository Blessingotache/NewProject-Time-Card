This project represents a collective effort, centered around developing an SQL-based solution, submitted as the capstone project for the KAD ICT HUB training. The core objective of this 
endeavor is to devise a computerized time card management system for New Project Ltd, aimed at monitoring employee working hours, with the construction carried out in Microsoft SQL Server 
Management Studio.
To achieved this, my development team needs to perform the following tasks:
1. Create a database called TimeCard.
2. Create the schemas called Payment, ProjectDetails, CustomerDetails, and HumanResources.
3. Create the table designs as per the relationship diagram ensuring minimum disk space utilization.
4. Validate the tables.
5. Create appropriate relationships between the tables.
6. Create appropriate indexes to speed up the executions of the following tasks:
􀁺 Extracting the time card details for an employee based on employee names
􀁺 Extracting the expense details for all employees with time card IDs in a given range
􀁺 Displaying the name of an employee with the list of all the projects he has worked on
􀁺 Extracting a list of all projects that need to be completed in the current month
7. Implement a proper security policy in the database. For this, create logins for Sam, John, and Samantha. Sam is the database administrator of the database server. John and Samantha have
 read/write permissions on the database server.
8. Store all confidential data in encrypted format.
9. Back up the database and store the backup in the C drive.
